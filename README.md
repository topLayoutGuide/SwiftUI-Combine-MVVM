# SwiftUI-Combine-MVVM
_An experiment with SwiftUI to build a clean MVVM architecture with Combine._

One of the best reasons to use MVVM, is that most, if not all of your business logic can be easily unit tested. SwiftUI introduced data binding on the "View" layer, and it's awesome, however this experiment adds a view model to make it as testable as possible.
